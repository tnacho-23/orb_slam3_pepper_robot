# ROS wrapper for ORB-SLAM3: The Pepper case

Adadaptation for [Pepper Robot](https://github.com/uchile-robotics/maqui_bringup) of a ROS wrapper for [ORB-SLAM3](https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3). The main idea is to use the ORB-SLAM3 as a standalone library and interface with it instead of putting everything together. 



##TODO:

-make it work

-make a good readme :)
